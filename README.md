**Blind Compressive Normalization**

The algorithm recovers bias from a matrix of measurements without requiring quantitative standards. Estimation of dependencies that are leveraged to recover the bias is based on detectable redundancies in the data alone.

**Dependencies**

- anaconda >= 5.0.1
- pymanopt >= 0.2.3
- mpi4py >= 3.0.0 (optional)
