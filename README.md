Blind Compressive Normalization

The algorithm uses a (hopefully) large sample by feature matrix to detect systematic biases in qantitative data, assuming a low rank corruption and a certain incoherence between signal and corruption.

Dependencies:

anaconda2
pymanopt
mpi4py & MPI for parallel version
