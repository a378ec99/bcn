**Blind Compressive Normalization**

The algorithm uses a large (hopefully) sample by feature matrix to detect systematic biases across measurements, assuming a low rank corruption and a certain incoherence between signal and corruption.

**Dependencies**

- anaconda2
- pymanopt
- mpi4py (for parallel version)
